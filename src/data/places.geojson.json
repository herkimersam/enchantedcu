        "lore": "The undergraduate library sits at an intersection of ley lines and was intentionally built underground in order to take advantage of the magical energy said ley lines provide. The U of I actually binds magic into books from their press and sells them to other schools so said schools can drain them of energy and conduct magical research. One unexpected side effect of this is that the undergraduate library has gained sentience and is currently in contract negotiation with the school."

        "lore": "In the late 1800s Melissa Fridman performed multiple experiments attempting to create golems. To power her attempts she constructed a magic funnel, designed to gather ambient magical energy and channel it into a small area. While her experiments never succeeded, her funnel still exists to this day. It sits over the Orpheum Children's Museum. As a result, children who spend large amounts of time at the museum have a much greater chance to develop an affinity for magic."
